/**
 * The suite's minimum test count, applied as a node:test reporter.
 *
 * `node --test` exits 0 when a test file declares no tests, and when a
 * --test-name-pattern filters every test away, including one inherited through
 * NODE_OPTIONS. Either way the dropped tests never run and the run still reads as a pass,
 * on the gate that runs before an irreversible publish. `pnpm test` runs this reporter
 * beside spec, and it fails any run in which fewer than MIN_TESTS tests passed.
 *
 * The count comes from each file's own summary. The run's closing summary would miss
 * exactly the case this exists for: it counts a file that ran no tests as one passing
 * test named after the file, so emptying a file that held one test would leave the
 * total unchanged. A file that declares no tests sends no summary of its own. Skipped
 * and todo tests are not passes, so they do not count either.
